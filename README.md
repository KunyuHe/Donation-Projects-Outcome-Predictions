# Donation-Projects-Outcome-Predictions
In this project, I use both Random Forest and XGBoost to predict whether a donation project posted on DonorsChoose.org can get fully funded, based on information on each project, resources they requested, project essays posted and their outcomes. Training and test sets are split from projects posted before 01/01/2014.
